`all-smi` is a command-line utility for monitoring GPU and NPU hardware across multiple systems. It provides a real-time view of accelerator utilization, memory usage, temperature, power consumption, and other metrics. The tool is designed to be a cross-platform alternative to `nvidia-smi`, with support for NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA Jetson platforms, Apple Silicon GPUs, Tenstorrent NPUs, Rebellions NPUs, and Furiosa NPUs.

The application presents a terminal-based user interface with cluster overview, interactive sorting, and both local and remote monitoring capabilities. It also provides an API mode for Prometheus metrics integration.
